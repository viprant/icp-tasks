    A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes 
    can be eaten fresh as table grapes, used for making wine, 
    jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, vinegar, and grape seed oil, or dried as raisins, currants and sultanas.
