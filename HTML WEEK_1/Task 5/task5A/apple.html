   <p>Apples are mainly composed of carbs and water. They’re rich in simple sugars, such as fructose, sucrose, and glucose.

    Despite their high carb and sugar contents, their glycemic index (GI) is low, ranging 29–44
    
    The GI is a measure of how food affects the rise in blood sugar levels after eating. Low values are associated with various health benefits (6Trusted Source).
    
    Due to their high fiber and polyphenol counts, fruits often have a low GI score (7Trusted Source).
